<p>
The power of <code>create2</code> is <b>absurd and awesome</b>, but it is still fairly difficult to use for even some fairly basic purposes.
</p><p>
One useful feature is the ability to deploy a contract which can have its code <b>arbitrarily updated</b> in the future, to deal with bugs or incorporate new functionality, such as new EIPs.
</p><p>
It should be noted that this can <b>greatly impact the trust-profile</b> of an Ethereum Smart Contract, so it may not be useful in many cases and upgrade paths should generally be well protected. For example, by providing a time-lock on upgrades, so users have the option (and adequate time) to leave if they donâ€™t approve of the upgrade.
</p>
<h3>Why Upgrade?</h3>
<p>
Once an Ethereum contract has been deployed, traditionally there has been <b>no way to change its code</b>. This adds a certain level and a specific kind of trust, which while useful, means it is difficult to resolve certain problems.
</p><p>
The first reason to enable contract upgrades is to <b>correct bugs</b>. A bug can <a href="#">compromise</a> the security of a contract, render it <a href="#">unusable</a> or impact the user (or <a href="#">developer</a>) experience.
